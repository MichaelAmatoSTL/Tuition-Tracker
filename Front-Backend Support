Frontend Kotlin and Java language support:
1.	In the method declaration, typing an open brace automatically inserts the closing one
2.	Typing 'Enter' after '{' adds a closing brace (e.g. to the body of 'if' statement)
3.	Typing 'Enter' adds the needed number of indent characters, taking nesting into account
4.	Placing a caret on a brace leads to the matching brace being highlighted
5.	Backspace removing symbols and empty whitespaces
6.	Extend/Shrink selection works as expected, changing the selection to the corresponding range according to the AST nesting level
